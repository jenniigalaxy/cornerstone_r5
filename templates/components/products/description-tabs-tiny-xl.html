        <h3>The Print</h3>
        <p>Our panoramic prints begin as a high definition photo that is printed on heavy art stock paper to resist waviness and warping due to heat and humidity and then topped with a UV resistant coating to minimize fading. Our photography is original, not stock, and printed and framed in the USA.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Professionally Framed</h3>
        <p>Framing not only extends the life of your print, it showcases your fandom for all to see. Our framing is done in-house by our team of framers.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Frame Details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>20 3/8" wide x 12 1/2" tall:</strong> The print contains a beveled-cut mat and a black frame made with 7/8" wide flat wood moulding. It is topped with clear glass and ready-to-hang with two sawtooth hangers. </li>
